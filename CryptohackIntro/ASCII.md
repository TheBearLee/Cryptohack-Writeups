# ASCII

In this challenge, we begin to learn about different encoding types. We get to use ASCII for the first time. ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This was used to encode the alphabet and other commonly used symbols to integers so that the computers will understand them.

While using Python, we can use the simple functions ```chr()``` and ```ord()``` to switch back and forth between characters and integers.

To solve this challenge, we must iterate through the given array of integers and change them into their ASCII symbols to find the flag!
