Hexadecimal is a system of representing numbers that is based on 16. These numbers usually start with the expression "0x" followed by the numbers.

Each place is calculated by the power of 16. Given is an example:

$$ 0x12 = (1*16^1) + (2*16^0) => 18$$
The numbers can therefore range from 0-9 of course, but A-F is also added. You can use this to continue counting 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. This higher base allows a smaller amount of digits to represent larger numbers, which is why it is often used in computing for things such as memory addresses.
