# Understanding XOR

XOR is a logical function that is used with binary digits within computer science. It represents 'exclusive or'. This means that when comparing two binary numbers, when each digit is compared the result can be either one OR the other but NOT BOTH. Included is a truth table to explain the results-



|          | True(1) | False(0) |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| True(1)  | F       | T        |
| False(0) | T       | F        |
